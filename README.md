## Employee Retention Prediction

## Project Overview 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whrthwer data scientists are likely to seek job changes , aiding in talent retention and recruitment planning. It should help in optimizing retention strategies, proactive recruitment, and better resource allocation using a predictive model, comprehensive data visualizations, and a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms.

## Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-LabelEncoder
-SMOTE

## MODELS
-Logistic Regression
-Random Forest Classifier
-LightGBM Classifier
-XGBoost Classifier

##Evaluation Metrics
-Accuracy
-confusion Matrics
-Precision
-Recall
-F1-Score
ROC-AUC Score

## Outcome
Among all evaluated models, LightGBM achieved the highest ROC–AUC score and demonstrated balanced performance across both classes. While XGBoost showed slightly higher recall for the attrition class, LightGBM provided better overall class separation and stability. Therefore, LightGBM was selected as the final model for employee retention prediction
